        <p>Hi my name is Macey and i like to crochet harnesess for my 2 cats named Jack (But we call him 
		Toots) and Spotty (She is all white). 
 		</p 
		
      	<img src="/fit.jpg" alt="Toots fit checked" width="750">
        
        <p>Here is Toots and he will be my helper to fit the harness. 
		</p>

        <p>First you will want to check the size while you are crocheting. My cat took 52 links to fit 
		around his neck but you will want to make 3 links up around on the first circle. 
		</p>
		
		
		<img src="/big.jpg" alt="Toots looking big" width="750">
        
        <p>Step 2: make a circle of links about 64 links long for the body.Jack is big so 
		there will be a lot of big numbers. </p>

        <p>Step 3: time to connect the neck and body. Have one row of links that is about 11 links long 
		and connect it to the body links and neck links.   </p>

        <p>Step 4: Make a leash whith 100 links and when you make the 100th link make 20 more links for the 
		handle and connect it to the 100th link then do one line of links on the circle of 20
		links and crochet it to the neck part.
		</p>

        <p>All done!!!! This might make you tired like this stinker... If the harness does not turn out
		right then it's ok.</p>
